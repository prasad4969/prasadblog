# prasadblog
I have developed a blog website using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB as the database. This platform allows users to create and store blogs on various topics. The website features a blog page that displays titles and snippets of all blogs, with the ability to click on a title to view the full blog details. Additionally, there is a dedicated page for creating new blogs.
